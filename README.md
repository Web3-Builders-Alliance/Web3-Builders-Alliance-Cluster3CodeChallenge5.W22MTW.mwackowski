# Coding Challenge

 [x] Inside of cw3-fixed-multisig integration tests create a 3 of 5 multisig
 [x] It should control the counter contract, write a test that creates a proposal to increment the contract and then vote on it
 [x] Query the counter contract and assert that the count has incremented.
 [x] Once that proposal has passed add a new proposal to the test to reset the counter and then vote on that as well,
 [x] Query the counter contract again and assert that the count has been reset
 [x] You can use the provided cw3_controls_cw20 to help build out the test for the counter
